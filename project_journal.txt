1. Project set-up and Django environment deployment.

2. Git setup and first commit.

3. User story created - functional_tests 'expected fails'

4. Unit Tests vs Functional Tests:
    Functional tests: tests the app's function from user's POV
    Unit tests: tests the application from the dev's POV

5. TDD approach thus far:
    a. Start by writing functional test that describes the new functionality from user's POV

    b. Once we have a FAILING functional test, begin to brainstorm how to write CODE to get it to PASS
        - now write unit tests to define how we want our code to behave.
        - each line of production code we write should be tested by (at least) one unit test

    c. Once we have FAILING unit test, write small amount of application code, just to get unit test to pass.

    d. Now rerun functional tests and see if they pass, or at least show progress towards passing.  Use info to guide
        next steps - either write new unit tests, then new code, etc.

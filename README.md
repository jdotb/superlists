# TDD - *Test Driven Development: Obey The Testing Goat* (Project)
[Obey The Testing Goat](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/)

- With this project, I aim to show both my interest and familitiarity with testing and development using Python, Selenium, and Django.

- The book does an *amazing* job at coaching the reader through the entire TDD process.  

- I have made my own changes where I see fit, and also to make the app my own and not simply a regurgitation of the app presented in the book.

- The accompanied text entitled: project_journal.txt is just that, a journal of my thought process while completing this project.*

- *None* of the code in this repo has been copied and pasted from the book - not a single line.

## What is *superlists*?
Superlists is the name of the app that is being built - it's a 'to-do' list...but *super*

#### Disclaimer: This project is a work in progress
